Prepare on Linux
----------------

Install a recent ruby

    apt-get install ruby


install the nokogiri gem

    gem install nokogiri

if you run no transparent proxy you need to install the socksify gem too (Not needed for Tails or Whonix)

    gem install socksify

To have a better jpeg corruption check install jpeginfo (OPTIONAL)

    apt-get install jpeginfo


Prepare on Tails
----------------

### install packages via Synaptic Package Manager 

1. ruby 
* ruby-nokogiri 
* ruby1.9.1 (for compatibility) 
* check is "libruby1.9.1" also marked for install

### To be sure your TAILS will start with ruby after reboot set ruby as additional-software 

1. start nautilus as root 
* go to /live/persistent/TailsData_unlocked/ 
* open in gedit "live-additional-software.conf" 
* write per line: 

```
    ruby 
    ruby1.9.1 
    ruby-nokogiri 
```

* save the file 
* now you have done and it should work.
